# PROJECT-EULER
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. 
In fact, it is a really kind platform for new computer programming learners to practice computer programming.
Therefore, I would like to update all my codes I wrote about Project Euler in this repository.
One thing to be clear that all my codes are written in JAVA.
