## About Project Euler
- **Project Euler** is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. 
- There are actually more than six hundred problems sorted by difficulty on that website waiting to be solved. Meanwhile, the contributors are still updating the problems.
- See more on https://projecteuler.net/about

## About problem solving
- Most codes are written in Java while some of them are in C++, which require **JDK10** or gcc to compile and run(I have replace all potential type with "var").
- Some of the solutions are not efficient enough to get the right answer in a second, therefore, pull requests are welcomed with better and faster algorithms.
