## About Project Euler
- Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. 
- There are actually more than six hundred problems sorted by difficulty on that website waiting to be solved. Meanwhile, the contributors are still updating the problems.
- See more on https://projecteuler.net/about

## About problem solving
- All codes are writtln in Java, which require JDK8+ to compile and run.
- I stick to solve at least one problem every day and update them here.
- Some of the solutions are not efficient enough to get the right answer in a second, therefore, if anybody have any advice or better algorithms, please email me : runmingli_edu@163.com
